    <h1>Refactor the number guessing game to use functions for each part of the game logic. Store the scores from each round in an array. At the conclusion of the game, output the array to display all the scores recorded during the game. This approach will help organize the game code and facilitate tracking of player performance across multiple rounds.</h1>
